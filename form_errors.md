# 1. **Defining a Form**:
   ```python
# In Django, form errors occur when user input doesn't meet the validation criteria defined in your forms. When a form is submitted and contains errors,
#you can display these errors to the user to provide feedback on what went wrong and guide them on how to correct their input. Here's how you can handle and display form errors in Django:
# Start by defining your form using Django's `forms.Form` or `forms.ModelForm` class. Specify the fields, their types, and any validation rules.
   from django import forms

   class MyForm(forms.Form):
       name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
       email = forms.EmailField()
# In your template, you can loop through the form's errors and display them near the corresponding input fields.
# Django's form rendering will automatically display errors if you use the `{{ form.field.errors }}` template variable.
   ```

# 2. **Displaying Form Errors in Templates**:

   ```html
   <form method="post">
       {% csrf_token %}
       <label for="{{ form.name.id_for_label }}">Name:</label>
       {{ form.name }}
       {{ form.name.errors }}
       <br>
       <label for="{{ form.email.id_for_label }}">Email:</label>
       {{ form.email }}
       {{ form.email.errors }}
       <br>
       <button type="submit">Submit</button>
   </form>
   ```

# 3. **Handling Form Submission in Views**:

   ```python
# In your view, when you receive a POST request, you need to instantiate the form with the submitted data and then check if it's valid.
# If the form is not valid, errors will be stored in the `form.errors` attribute.
   from django.shortcuts import render
   from .forms import MyForm

   def my_view(request):
       if request.method == 'POST':
           form = MyForm(request.POST)
           if form.is_valid():
               # Process valid form data
               # ...
           else:
               # Form has errors
               return render(request, 'my_template.html', {'form': form})
       else:
           form = MyForm()

       return render(request, 'my_template.html', {'form': form})
   ```

# 4. **Customizing Error Messages**:

   ```python
# You can customize error messages by using the `error_messages` parameter when defining your form fields.
 #This allows you to specify messages for specific validation errors.
   class MyForm(forms.Form):
       name = forms.CharField(max_length=100, error_messages={
           'required': 'Please provide your name.',
           'max_length': 'Your name is too long.'
       })
#  Sometimes, you might want to display errors that aren't associated with a specific field. These are often called non-field errors.
 #You can access these errors using `form.non_field_errors` in your template.
   ```

# 5. **Displaying Non-Field Errors**:

   ```html
   <ul>
       {% for error in form.non_field_errors %}
           <li>{{ error }}</li>
       {% endfor %}
   </ul>
   ```
```python
# By effectively displaying form errors, you help users understand what went wrong and provide clear guidance on how to fix their input.
 #This improves the overall user experience of your web application.
```


# some code snippet I saw online
```html
 {% if form.errors %}
{% for field in form %}
{% for error in field.errors %}
<div class="alert alert-danger">
<strong>{{ error|escape}}</strong>
</div>
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% for error in form.non_field_errors %}
<div class="alert alert-danger">
<strong>{{ error|escape }}</strong>
</div>
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```
```python
# Notes
# 1: You can loop through fields of a form 
# 2: you can access field erros by doing field.errors
# 3: you can loop through those field errors and display them
# 4: you can access non-field errors by doing form.non_field errors
# 5: you can also loop through them and display them
# By convention non-field errors are displayed at the top of the form and field ones at the bottom or near the field
```
