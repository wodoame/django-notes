In Django REST framework, the **context** argument allows you to pass additional data to a serializer. This context can be useful for various purposes, such as accessing request information or customizing serialization logic. When instantiating a serializer, you can provide a context dictionary, which can then be accessed within any serializer field logic using the `self.context` attribute.

Here's how you can use the **context** argument in a serializer:

1. **Passing Context to a Serializer:**
   ```python
   from rest_framework import serializers

   class CommentSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
       email = serializers.EmailField()
       content = serializers.CharField(max_length=200)
       created = serializers.DateTimeField()

   # Instantiate the serializer with context (e.g., request data)
   serializer = CommentSerializer(comment, context={'request': request})
   ```

2. **Accessing Context Data:**
   Inside the serializer, you can access the context data (e.g., `request.user`) using `self.context`:
   ```python
   def validate_content(self, value):
       # Access request.user from context
       user = self.context['request'].user
       # Custom validation logic here
       return value
   ```

Remember that the **context** parameter allows you to pass any relevant data to your serializer, making it more flexible and adaptable to different scenarios.

Note that the `get_serializer_context()` method in DRF generic views returns `request`, `view`, and `format` as default contexts. 
I had to access the request object in a serializer one time and it was present in the `self.context` dictionary. So I did `request self.context.get('request')` in order to use `request.user`
