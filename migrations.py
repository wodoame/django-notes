# In Django, migrations are used to manage and apply changes to the database schema.
# Each migration file contains Python code that specifies how the database should be altered, including creating or modifying tables, fields, and indexes.
# Django keeps track of which migrations have been applied to a database through a special table called `django_migrations`.
# This table records the names of the applied migration files and their execution order.

# If you add `db.sqlite` to your `.gitignore` file, it will prevent the SQLite database file from being included in your version control system (like Git).
# However, the migrations themselves, which define the structure of the database, will still be part of your version control.

# When someone else clones your repository and runs migrations, Django will use the migration files to apply the changes to their local database.
# So, while the actual database file is not shared through version control, the schema and structure defined by the migrations are used to recreate the database on each developer's machine.
