In Django, the `render` function is a shortcut that combines a given template with a context dictionary and returns an `HttpResponse` object with that rendered text. It's the most commonly used method for rendering templates in views. Here's a basic example:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def my_view(request):
    context = {
        'key': 'value',
    }
    return render(request, 'my_template.html', context)
```

This function is preferred over the older `render_to_response` method, which was used in earlier versions of Django. The `render` function is more concise and automatically uses a `RequestContext`, which is necessary for template context processors to work correctly.
