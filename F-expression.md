The **'F' expression** in Django represents the value of a model field or a calculated value based on a model field. It allows you to refer to field values and perform database operations without having to fetch them into Python memory. Here are some examples of how you can use it:
Remember to import F using `from django.db.models import F`

1. **Filtering**: You can use `F` to filter objects based on a model's field. For instance, to find companies with more employees than chairs:
   ```python
   Company.objects.filter(num_employees__gt=F("num_chairs"))
   ```

2. **Calculations**: You can perform calculations using `F`. For example, to find companies with at least twice as many employees as chairs:
   ```python
   Company.objects.filter(num_employees__gt=F("num_chairs") * 2)
   ```

3. **Annotations**: Annotate models with aggregated values. Both forms below are equivalent:
   ```python
   Company.objects.annotate(num_products=Count("products"))
   Company.objects.annotate(num_products=Count(F("products")))
   ```

4. **Ordering**: You can use `F` in `order_by()`. For instance, ordering by the length of the company name:
   ```python
   from django.db.models.functions import Length
   Company.objects.order_by(Length(F("name")).asc())
   # Or really just without the F expression like this:
   Company.objects.order_by(Length(F"name").asc())
   ```

Remember, `F` allows you to work with model fields directly in your queries, making your code more efficient and concise!
