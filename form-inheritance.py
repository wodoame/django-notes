# In Django, you can inherit forms to create new forms with shared fields, methods, and behaviors.
# Inheritance allows you to build on existing forms and reuse their functionality, which can help you write clean and maintainable code. You can inherit forms in two main ways:

# 1. **Inheriting from Multiple Forms**:
# You can inherit from multiple forms to combine their fields and behaviors into a single form. This is useful when you have different forms with distinct functionalities and want to create a form that incorporates elements from multiple sources.
# Here's an example:

   from django import forms

   class BaseForm1(forms.Form):
       field1 = forms.CharField()

   class BaseForm2(forms.Form):
       field2 = forms.IntegerField()

   class CombinedForm(BaseForm1, BaseForm2):
       field3 = forms.EmailField()

# In this example, `CombinedForm` inherits from `BaseForm1` and `BaseForm2`, so it has fields from both parent forms (`field1`, `field2`) as well as its own field (`field3`).

# 2. **Inheriting from ModelForms**:
# You can also inherit from `ModelForm` to create forms for Django models. This is commonly used when you want to create forms for different models that share some common fields.

   from django import forms
   from .models import Model1, Model2

   class CommonModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
       class Meta:
           model = Model1  # Specify the model you want to create a form for

   class Model2Form(CommonModelForm):
       class Meta(CommonModelForm.Meta):
           model = Model2  # Inherit from CommonModelForm and specify a different model

# In this example, `Model2Form` inherits from `CommonModelForm`, and you can customize it by specifying a different model in its `Meta` class.
# Inheritance can be a powerful way to promote code reuse and maintainability in your Django applications.
# It allows you to define common fields, validation rules, and methods in a base form and then build specialized forms by inheriting from it.
# This can help reduce code duplication and make your code more organized and easier to maintain.
