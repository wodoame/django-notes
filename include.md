The `{% include %}` tag in Django is a powerful tool for reusing templates. It allows you to include the content of one template within another, which is particularly useful for maintaining consistent layouts or repeating elements across multiple pages.

### Basic Usage
To include a template, you use the `{% include %}` tag followed by the name of the template file you want to include. For example:

```html
{% include "footer.html" %}
```

This will insert the content of `footer.html` at the location of the `{% include %}` tag.

### Passing Variables
You can also pass variables to the included template using the `with` keyword. Here's an example:

```html
{% include "mymenu.html" with me="TOBIAS" sponsor="W3SCHOOLS" %}
```

In `mymenu.html`, you can then use these variables like this:

```html
<div>HOME | {{ me }} | ABOUT | FORUM | {{ sponsor }}</div>
```

### Benefits
- **Reusability**: Helps in reusing common template snippets across different templates.
- **Maintainability**: Makes it easier to update common sections of your site, as changes in the included template will reflect everywhere it's used.
