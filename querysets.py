# Combining querysets (This does not handle uniqueness of elements)
queryset1 = Model.objects.filter(field1='value1')
queryset2 = Model.objects.filter(field2='value2')

# Use the '|' operator to create a new queryset that contains elements from both querysets
combined_queryset = queryset1 | queryset2

# In Django, you can make a queryset contain unique items after performing some combination by using the distinct() method.
# This method is often used with .values() or .values_list() to specify the fields by which you want to make the queryset's items unique. 
# Here's an example:

# Assuming you have a model called MyModel
from myapp.models import MyModel

# Create a queryset with some combination
queryset = MyModel.objects.filter(some_condition).values('field1', 'field2')

# Make the queryset contain unique items based on 'field1' and 'field2'
unique_queryset = queryset.distinct()

# Now unique_queryset will contain only unique items after the combination

# In this example, values('field1', 'field2') is used to select specific fields from the model, and then distinct() ensures that only unique 
# combinations of those fields are returned in the queryset.
# Remember to replace 'field1' and 'field2' with the actual field names you're interested in.
