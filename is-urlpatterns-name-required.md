Django **only cares about `urlpatterns` in the root `urls.py` file** (the one specified in `ROOT_URLCONF` in `settings.py`). When you use the `include()` function to reference other URL configuration files, Django doesn’t directly inspect them for a variable named `urlpatterns`.

### **How `include()` Works:**
- The `include()` function in Django allows you to modularize URLs by including other URL configuration modules.
- When Django encounters `include()`, it expects the included module to **return a list of URL patterns**, but it doesn't require the list to be named `urlpatterns`.

---

### **Example:**

#### **Root `urls.py`:**
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('blog/', include('blog.urls')),
]
```

#### **`blog/urls.py` with a different name:**
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

blog_patterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('<int:post_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
]
```

In this case, the `include('blog.urls')` will work, even though the patterns in `blog/urls.py` are stored in `blog_patterns` instead of `urlpatterns`.

---

### **What `include()` Does:**

- When you use `include()`, Django loads the module (`blog.urls`) and expects it to **return** a list of URL patterns. 
- This works because `include()` allows you to return any iterable of URL patterns from the module, regardless of the variable name.

#### Example with an iterable:

```python
# blog/urls.py
from django.urls import path

blog_patterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('<int:post_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
]

# You can explicitly pass the list to `include()`
```

In `ROOT` urls.py:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('blog/', include((blog_patterns, 'blog'))),
]
```

---

### **Conclusion:**

- For the root `urls.py`, Django looks specifically for `urlpatterns`.
- In included files, any iterable of patterns will work, as long as it’s passed correctly to `include()`.
