To implement file upload and download functionality in a Django web application, follow these steps:

1. **Setting Up Your Django Project:**
   - Create a new Django project (if you haven't already).
   - Create an app within your project (e.g., `fileuploads`).

2. **Define a Model for Uploaded Files:**
   - In `fileuploads/models.py`, create a model to represent uploaded files. For example:
     ```python
     from django.db import models

     class UploadedFile(models.Model):
         file = models.FileField(upload_to='uploads/')
         uploaded_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
     ```
     This model includes a `FileField` to store the uploaded file and a timestamp.

3. **Create Views:**
   - In `fileuploads/views.py`, define views for file uploads and downloads:
     ```python
     from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
     from django.http import HttpResponse
     from .models import UploadedFile
     from .forms import UploadFileForm

     def upload_file(request):
         if request.method == 'POST':
             form = UploadFileForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
             if form.is_valid():
                 form.save()
                 return redirect('upload_file')
         else:
             form = UploadFileForm()
         files = UploadedFile.objects.all()
         return render(request, 'upload_file.html', {'form': form, 'files': files})

     def download_file(request, file_id):
         uploaded_file = UploadedFile.objects.get(pk=file_id)
         response = HttpResponse(uploaded_file.file, content_type='application/force-download')
         response['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename="{uploaded_file.file.name}"'
         return response
     ```

4. **Create a Form for File Uploads:**
   - In `fileuploads/forms.py`, define an `UploadFileForm` form.

5. **Templates and URLs:**
   - Create templates (e.g., `upload_file.html`) to display the upload form and list of files.
   - Configure URLs to map views to specific endpoints.

6. **Run Migrations:**
   - Apply migrations to create the database table for the `UploadedFile` model.

7. **Test Your Implementation:**
   - Start your Django development server and test file uploads and downloads.

Remember to adjust the code according to your specific requirements and project structure.
