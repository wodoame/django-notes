# In Django, the `order_by()` method is used to specify the ordering of query results.
# It is typically applied to a queryset to define the order in which the records should be retrieved from the database.

# Here's a simple example:

from myapp.models import MyModel

# Get all objects from MyModel ordered by the 'name' field in ascending order
queryset = MyModel.objects.all().order_by('name')

# Get all objects from MyModel ordered by the 'date_created' field in descending order
queryset = MyModel.objects.all().order_by('-date_created')


# In the first example, the `order_by('name')` specifies that the queryset should be ordered by the 'name' field in ascending order.
# In the second example, `order_by('-date_created')` orders the queryset by the 'date_created' field in descending order.

# You can also use multiple fields for ordering, and the order of the fields in the `order_by()` method determines their priority. For example:


# Order by 'category' in ascending order, then by 'price' in descending order
queryset = MyModel.objects.all().order_by('category', '-price')


# This orders the queryset first by 'category' in ascending order and then by 'price' in descending order.
# Remember to replace `'myapp.models'` and `'MyModel'` with the actual app and model names in your Django project.

# Keep in mind that the `order_by()` method returns a new queryset with the specified ordering; it doesn't modify the existing queryset in place.
# If you want to apply multiple ordering criteria dynamically, you can chain multiple `order_by()` calls or use the `annotate()` method along with `F()` expressions for more complex ordering scenarios.
