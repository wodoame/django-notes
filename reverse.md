In Django, you can use the `reverse()` function to generate URLs based on view names or callable view objectsÂ¹. Here's how it works:

1. **Using View Names:**
   - If you have a named URL pattern (e.g., `news-archive`), you can reverse it like this:
     ```python
     from django.urls import reverse

     # Example with a named URL
     url = reverse("news-archive")
     ```

2. **Using Callable View Objects:**
   - You can also reverse a view by passing the actual view function or class:
     ```python
     from news import views

     # Example with a callable view
     url = reverse(views.archive)
     ```

3. **Passing Arguments:**
   - If your URL pattern accepts arguments (e.g., capturing a year), you can provide them using `args` or `kwargs`:
     ```python
     # Example with arguments
     url = reverse("arch-summary", args=[1945])
     # Or using kwargs
     url = reverse("admin:app_list", kwargs={"app_label": "auth"})
     ```

Remember that `reverse()` raises a `NoReverseMatch` exception if no match can be found. Also, avoid using patterns with alternative choices (using the vertical bar `|` character) in `reverse()`.
