In Django REST Framework (DRF) serialization, the `source` keyword is used within serializer fields to specify the source of data for that field. This keyword is particularly useful when you want to retrieve data from a different attribute or method of the model instance being serialized, rather than directly from the model field itself.

Here's how you can use the `source` keyword in DRF serialization:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from myapp.models import MyModel

class MyModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    # Assuming MyModel has fields 'name' and 'description'
    # but you want to serialize 'title' instead of 'name' (That is you want 'title' to be displayed as your json keyword instead of 'name' eg. {title: 'something'})
    # 'source' will indicate that the value of title should be taken from the 'name' field

    title = serializers.CharField(source='name')  # 'name' is the source for 'title' field

    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
        fields = ('id', 'title', 'description')
```

In this example, `source='name'` indicates that the `title` field should be populated with data from the `name` attribute of the `MyModel` instance, rather than from a field directly named `title` in the model.

You can also use `source` to point to methods on the model instance:

```python
class MyModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    # Assuming there's a method named 'get_custom_description' in MyModel
    # and you want to use its result as the description

    description = serializers.CharField(source='get_custom_description')

    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
        fields = ('id', 'name', 'description')
```

Here, `source='get_custom_description'` indicates that the `description` field should be populated with the result of calling the `get_custom_description` method on the `MyModel` instance.

Using `source` gives you flexibility in how you represent data in your serializers, allowing you to manipulate and customize the serialization process according to your specific requirements.
