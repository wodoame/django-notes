The `get_queryset()` method in Django REST framework (DRF) allows you to customize the queryset returned by a view. When you override this method, you can filter the queryset in various ways based on your requirements. Here are some common scenarios where you might use `get_queryset()`:

1. **Filtering against the Current User:**
   You can filter the queryset to ensure that only results relevant to the currently authenticated user making the request are returned. For example:
   ```python
   from myapp.models import Purchase
   from myapp.serializers import PurchaseSerializer
   from rest_framework import generics

   class PurchaseList(generics.ListAPIView):
       serializer_class = PurchaseSerializer

       def get_queryset(self):
           """Return a list of all purchases for the currently authenticated user."""
           user = self.request.user
           return Purchase.objects.filter(purchaser=user)
   ```

2. **Filtering against the URL:**
   If your URL configuration contains an entry like `re_path('^purchases/(?P<username>.+)/$', PurchaseList.as_view())`, you can write a view that returns a purchase queryset filtered by the username portion of the URL:
   ```python
   class PurchaseList(generics.ListAPIView):
       serializer_class = PurchaseSerializer

       def get_queryset(self):
           """Return a list of all purchases for the user determined by the username portion of the URL."""
           username = self.kwargs['username']
           return Purchase.objects.filter(purchaser__username=username)
   ```

3. **Filtering against Query Parameters:**
   You can determine the initial queryset based on query parameters in the URL. For example, if your URL is `http://example.com/api/purchases?username=denvercoder9`, you can filter the queryset only if the `username` parameter is included:
   ```python
   class PurchaseList(generics.ListAPIView):
       serializer_class = PurchaseSerializer

       def get_queryset(self):
           """Optionally restrict the returned purchases to a given user, based on the `username` query parameter in the URL."""
           queryset = Purchase.objects.all()
           username = self.request.query_params.get('username')
           if username is not None:
               queryset = queryset.filter(purchaser__username=username)
           return queryset
   ```

Additionally, DRF supports generic filtering backends that allow you to construct complex searches and filters. These filters can also present themselves as HTML controls in the browsable API and admin API.
