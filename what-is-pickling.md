In Django, caching supports Python data types that can be "pickled." Pickling is a process in Python used to serialize and deserialize objects, meaning it converts Python objects into a byte stream (serialization) and then back into objects (deserialization).

When an object is pickled, it can be stored in a cache and later retrieved in its original form. Most common Python objects, such as strings, lists, dictionaries, and even custom objects, can be pickled. This allows you to cache complex data structures and retrieve them efficiently.

For example, if you have a list of dictionaries representing user data, you can pickle this list and store it in the cache. When you need it again, you can unpickle it and get back the original list of dictionaries.

Here's a simple example:

```python
import pickle

# Original data
data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

# Pickling the data
pickled_data = pickle.dumps(data)

# Unpickling the data
unpickled_data = pickle.loads(pickled_data)

print(unpickled_data)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```
In Django, you can use caching backends like Redis or Memcached to store these pickled objects.
